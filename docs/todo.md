# TODO

- [ ] Write documentation (determine what I really want)
- [ ] Be clear and careful about the **error stack**, especially `ChamberError`.
- [ ] Environment variables `BURROW_DEBUG`; logging system (`zerolog`).
- [ ] Core decoration needs more commands: `decoration install`, `decoration remove`, `burrow build`.
- [ ] Carton/decoration directory structure (DDD)
- [ ] Make the kernel as clean as possible. More everything to core instead.
